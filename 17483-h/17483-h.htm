<p>There appears to be, from year to year, a growing popular taste for quaint
and curious reminiscences of "Ye Olden Time," and to meet this, Mr. Henry
M. Brooks has prepared a series of interesting handbooks. The materials
have been gleaned chiefly from old newspapers of Boston and Salem, sources
not easily accessible, and while not professing to be history, the volumes
contain much material for history, so combined and presented as to be both
amusing and instructive. The titles of some of the volumes indicate their
scope and their promise of entertainment:&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p>"It has been the good fortune of the writer to be allowed a peep at the
manuscript for this series, and he can assure the lovers of the historical and
the quaint in literature that something both valuable and pleasant is in store
for them. In the specialties treated of in these books Mr. Brooks has been for
many years a careful collector and student, and it is gratifying to learn that the
material is to be committed to book form."&mdash;<i>Salem Gazette</i>.</p>

<h1>NEW-ENGLAND SUNDAY.</h1>
<hr style='width: 25%;' />
<p><span class="smcap">Seeing</span> in an old paper that General
Washington was stopped by a "tythingman"
in Connecticut in 1789 for the
"crime" of riding on Sunday, we were naturally
led to think about the "Sabbath question,"
as it is sometimes called. We find
the account referred to in the "Columbian
Centinel" for December, 1789.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center"><span class="smtxt">THE</span> <i>PRESIDENT</i> <span class="smtxt">AND THE</span> <i>TYTHINGMAN</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg&nbsp;2]</a></span>
The Pre&#383;ident, on his return to New-York from
his late tour, through Connecticut, having mi&#383;&#383;ed his
way on Saturday, was obliged to ride a few miles on
Sunday morning, in order to gain the town, at which
he had previou&#383;ly propo&#383;ed to have attended divine
&#383;ervice.&mdash;Before he arrived, however, he was met by
a Tythingman, who commanding him to &#383;top, demanded
the occa&#383;ion of his riding; and it was not
until the Pre&#383;ident had informed him of every circum&#383;tance,
and promi&#383;ed to go no further than the town
intended, that the Tythingman would permit him to
proceed on his journey.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />
<p>This Sunday question has been so often discussed
of late years, and the opinions expressed
on the same are so diverse, that it may be well
to print a few selections on the subject from
some of the old newspapers, that those who
are interested may see, as a matter of curiosity,
if for no other reason, what views have been
entertained within the past century, more
especially in New England, in reference to
Sunday.</p>

<p>In a Salem paper of 1775 the following
notice appeared:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg&nbsp;3]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Whereas</span> the sober and thoughtful People of
this Town are much displeased by the great
Noise and Disturbance made in the Streets, on Saturday
and Sabbath Day Evenings. It is earnestly desired
that all Heads of Families would keep their
Children and Servants at Home, on those Evenings,
and thereby greatly contribute to the Quiet of the
Town and Peace of the Inhabitants.</p></div>

<p>The appearance of Essex Street in Salem at
the present time on Saturday evening would
seem to indicate that "heads of families"
do not now "keep their children and servants
at home."</p>

<p>From a communication in the "Massachusetts
Centinel," April 30, 1788, "riding on
the Sunday" is held to be a "flagrant crime."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center"><i>For the</i> CENTINEL.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the devoting one day in &#383;even to religious purpo&#383;es
is a bounden duty we owe to God our
creator, and a mo&#383;t rea&#383;onable law of our Commonwealth&mdash;to
&#383;ee people riding on the Sunday in pur&#383;uit
of their worldly affairs, is &#383;o di&#383;gu&#383;ting to the man of
true principle, that the neglect of our executive
authority of &#383;o flagrant a crime, is to be lamented.
The common practice of a Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;fl&mdash;&mdash;n of H-pk&mdash;&mdash;n
is notorious on this account. Would not wi&#383;h to
traduce the character of any man, but would only
query, whether &#383;uch conduct is not highly reprehen&#383;ible,
and de&#383;erving the cognizance of the magi&#383;trate.</p>

This is not at all strange from the point of
view from which Sunday was then regarded.
Indeed many people feel about the same now.
They would have the old laws enforced in regard
to riding and neglect of public worship.
They have fears that the day may degenerate
into a European Sunday, with prayers in the
morning and amusements in the afternoon and
evening.</p>

<p>The changes in the past fifty years in reference
to Sunday have indeed been very great,
but we think they arise chiefly from a reaction
from the too strict Puritanism of the past.
While we would not have the day too strictly
kept, we yet have no sympathy with that class
of minds who think there should be no "day
of rest" or no time set apart for religious
exercises or church services, but would have
all days exactly alike.</p>

<p>According to the "Salem Mercury" of
Aug. 12, 1788, the ministers of Connecticut,
in convention, publish an address on the "increasing
negligence of the Publick Worship of
God," etc.</p>

SALEM, <span class="smcap">August</span> 12.</p>

<p>The Mini&#383;ters of the State of Connecticut, convened
in General A&#383;&#383;ociation, have publi&#383;hed a &#383;erious,
&#383;en&#383;ible, plain Addre&#383;s to the People of the Churches
and Societies under their pa&#383;toral care, on the &#383;ubject
of the increa&#383;ing negligence of the Publick Wor&#383;hip
of God; which they con&#383;ider as one of the mo&#383;t painful
and alarming, among the various in&#383;tances of declen&#383;ion
and immorality, which at the pre&#383;ent time
threaten the very exi&#383;tence of religion in this country.&mdash;"In
what manner," &#383;ays the Addre&#383;s, "does
this evil affect the political intere&#383;ts, the e&#383;&#383;ential wellbeing,
of the community? All the branches of morality
are indi&#383;&#383;olubly connected. From one breach
of moral obligation to a &#383;econd, to a third, and to all,
the tran&#383;ition is ea&#383;y, nece&#383;&#383;ary and rapid. From negligence
of the duties we owe to God, the pa&#383;&#383;age is
&#383;hort to contempt for tho&#383;e we owe to men. The
Sabbath, in the judgment of rea&#383;on and of revelation,
is the great hinge on which all the&#383;e duties are turned.
When the ordinances of this holy day are for&#383;aken
and forgotten, the whole &#383;y&#383;tem of moral obligation
mu&#383;t of cour&#383;e be also forgotten; the great, &#383;ub&#383;tantial
and permanent good, of which religion is the only
&#383;ource, is effectually de&#383;troyed; the political peace
and welfare of a community, the &#383;alvation of the
human &#383;oul, the infinitely benevolent de&#383;igns of redeeming
love, the in&#383;titution of the means of grace,
and the obedience and &#383;ufferings of the Son of God,
are fru&#383;trated and &#383;et at nought. Thus, by one effectual
blow of &#383;in, and the friends of &#383;in, are all the great
and valuable intere&#383;ts of mankind overthrown."</p></div>

Although our remarks are confined to
America, we may mention that it has been
stated by some of our own countrymen who
have visited London that Sunday is generally
as well observed there as in New England;
yet we find in the "Salem Gazette" of Nov. 23,
1785, that the attendance on public worship
in London was then rather small as compared
with what might have been seen in Boston at
the same date. But that was before the days of
the "sensation" preachers, as they are called,&mdash;Spurgeon,
Beecher, Talmage, and men of
that stamp, who now draw crowds of people,
many of whom are not always the most religious
in the community, but who love excitement
rather than quiet contemplation.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">LONDON,</p>

<p><i>Sept.</i> 13. Sunday being a day of re&#383;t, 739 hor&#383;es
were ye&#383;terday engaged on <i>parties of plea&#383;ure</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
In fifty churches, ea&#383;tward of Temple-bar, the
congregations amounted, on an average, to <i>&#383;even</i> for
each church in the morning, and <i>five</i> in the afternoon.
This &#383;hews the &#383;tate of the Chri&#383;tian religion in the
metropolis to be far better than could be expected!</p>

<p>The following extract from the "Belfast
Patriot" of 1825 shows how the "Lord's day"
was regarded in 1776 in the "District of
Maine."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Fifty Years Ago.</span> At a town meeting, held on
the common, on the south end of lot No. 26, probably
where the meeting house now stands, on the
east side of the river, in Belfast, Oct. 10th, 1776,
the town then having been incorporated two years&mdash;among
other things "to see if there can be any plan
laid to stop the Inhabitants from visiting on Sunday."
"Voted, That if any person makes unnecessary vizits
on the Sabeth they shall be Lookt on with Contempt
untill they make acknowledgement to the Public."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>Houses of worship were formerly "as cold
as a barn."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
Notwithstanding all the comforts and conveniences
of modern places of worship, to say
nothing about the more interesting preaching
and other exercises, some people consider it a
hardship to be obliged to attend even one service
on Sunday. How was it in "old times"?
Our ancestors were obliged to conform to the
prevalent custom of going to meeting whether
they liked it or not. The law did not then
excuse any one from attendance at public worship,
except for sickness. Not to be a "meeting-goer"
in those days was to range one's
self with thieves and robbers and other outlaws.
No matter if the meeting-house was
cold, and there was danger of consumption;
it was apparently "more pleasing to the
Lord" that a man should get sick attending
services in "his house" than by staying away
preserve his health. Mr. Felt, in his "Annals
of Salem," says: "For a long period the
people of our country did not consider that a
comfortable degree of warmth while at public
worship contributed much to a profitable hearing
of the gospel. The first stove we have
heard of in Massachusetts for a meeting-house
was put up by the First congregation
of Boston in 1773. In Salem the Friends'
Society had two plate-stoves brought from
Philadelphia in 1793. The North Church
had one in 1809; the South had a brick Russian
stove in 1812. About the same date the
First Church had a stove and the Tabernacle
had one also. The objections that [to heat
churches] was contrary to the custom of their
hardy fathers and mothers, [and that it] was
an indication of extravagance and degeneracy,
had ceased to be advanced. Not a few remember
the general knocking of feet on cold
days and near the close of long sermons. On
such occasions the Rev. Dr. Hopkins used to
say, now and then: 'My hearers, have a little
patience, and I will soon close.'"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
Mr. Felt says that Hugh Peters (one of the
ministers of the First Church) was represented
by an English painter as in a pulpit with a
large assembly before him, turning an hour-glass
and using these words: "I know you are
good fellows, stay and take another glass."</p>

A Gentleman in the State of Connecticut, regularly
attended publick wor&#383;hip on the Lord's
day with all his family: On the Sunday evening he
always catechi&#383;ed his children and &#383;ervants on the
principles of religion, and what they heard the mini&#383;ter
deliver from the pulpit. He had a negro man
who never could remember a note of the &#383;ermon,
though otherwi&#383;e &#383;mart. At la&#383;t his ma&#383;ter peremptorily
told him he would on Monday morning tie him
up and flog him. Next Sunday evening, when interrogated,
he had forgotten all: On Monday morning
his ma&#383;ter executes his threat &#383;o far, as to tie him
up. The fellow then cried out, O ma&#383;ter &#383;pare me,
for I remember &#383;omething the mini&#383;ter &#383;aid. What
is it? &#383;aid the ma&#383;ter. The fellow replied, "<i>This
much may &#383;uffice at this time.</i>" His ma&#383;ter was &#383;o
plea&#383;ed with his wit that he forgave him.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>From the Rev. Dr. Bentley's notes, edited
by Stanley Waters, printed in the "Salem
Gazette," we learn that even in old times
people occasionally absented themselves from
public worship on the Lord's Day.</p>

<p>Under date of 1791 we read,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Jan. 23. No singing through the whole day&mdash;not
even an attempt. Mr. Le Favre Swan &amp; Parker
promised their assistance, but by drawing a prize of
&pound;300 in the Lottery they have been detained from
Public Worship.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
And in 1792,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mch. 11. Sunday. The Ship Grand Turk burdened
550 Tons sailed this day for India, Capt. B.
Hodges.</p>

<p>The previous invitations given to the principal
Gentlemen of the Town &amp; the fame of a ship built
in the Town &amp; furnished with Sails from our own manufactories
urged a curiosity so strong that few people
were left in our houses of worship. Weather fine.</p></div>

<p>Thus we see that pecuniary success and
pleasant weather were as influential in 1792 as
they are in 1886 in diverting individuals from
their ordinary religious privileges.</p>

Although doubts have often been expressed
as to the authenticity of certain Connecticut
"Blue Laws," it is probable that many laws
which have sometimes been referred to as such
were in the early days of the colony actually in
force,&mdash;as the following, which we find in an
old paper. They are certainly not much
stronger than laws of the time in Massachusetts.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>No one shall be a freeman, or give a vote, unless
he be converted, and a member in full communion,
of one of the Churches allowed in this dominion.</p>

<p>No one shall travel, cook victuals, make beds,
sweep house, cut hair, or shave, on the Sabbath day.</p>

<p>No woman shall kiss her child on the Sabbath, or

<p>No one shall run on the Sabbath day, or walk in
his garden, or elsewhere, except reverently to and

Some years ago, a law-book which had belonged
to Jonathan Trumbull, containing the
early statutes of Connecticut, was in the
possession of a Boston gentleman,<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> who informs
us that at the end of the volume, in
manuscript, were found reports of "Brother
Jonathan's" adjudications of small cases which
he tried as "justice of the peace." Among
them was one where "His Majesty's tythingman"
entered a complaint against Jona and
Susan Smith for a "profanation of the Sabbath;"
namely, "That on the &mdash;&mdash; day of &mdash;&mdash; during
Divine Service on the Lord's Day <i>they
did smile</i>." The culprits were adjudged to be
guilty of the offence, and severally fined "five
shillings and costs." This book was shown
to the late Professor Agassiz, who examined it
with great interest and then made the following
remark: "I find here evidence of the difference
between the Calvinism of Switzerland and the
Calvinism of America. I was brought up in
that faith. I went to meeting in the morning,
I danced with the parson's daughter on the
green in the afternoon, and I played whist
with the parson in the evening."</p>

to Sunday and to the proper observance
of Saturday evening:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Whereas it is the Duty of all Per&#383;ons, upon the
Lord's-Day carefully to apply them&#383;elves publickly
and privately to Religion and Piety, the Prophanation
of the Lord's-Day is highly offen&#383;ive to Almighty
God; of evil Example and tends to the Grief and
Di&#383;turbance of all pious and religiou&#383;ly di&#383;po&#383;ed persons.</p>

<p>Therefore that the Prophanation of the &#383;aid Day
may be fully prevented: Be it further enacted, That

Game Play or Recreation on the Lord's Day or any
part thereof &amp;c. &amp;c. under penalties of not exceeding
twenty &#383;hillings for every offence."</p></div>

<p>Travelling was also prohibited, and it was
enacted,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
"That if any Per&#383;on or Per&#383;ons &#383;hall be recreating,

any Per&#383;ons &#383;hall unnece&#383;&#383;arily a&#383;&#383;emble them&#383;elves in
any of the Streets, Lanes, Wharves, High-Ways,

Wor&#383;hip of God on the Lord's Day, they &#383;hall
forfeit and pay the &#383;um of ten &#383;hillings.</p>

<p>"And whereas many Per&#383;ons are of opinion that
the Sabbath or Time of religious Re&#383;t, begins on
Saturday evening, therefore to prevent all unnece&#383;&#383;ary
Di&#383;turbance of Per&#383;ons of &#383;uch Opinion, as well as
to encourage in all others a due and &#383;ea&#383;onable Preparation
for the religious Duties of the Lord's Day:
Be it further enacted, That no Per&#383;on &#383;hall keep
open any Shop, Ware-Hou&#383;e or Work-Hou&#383;e or hawk
or &#383;ell any Provi&#383;ions or Wares in Streets or Lanes
of any Town or Di&#383;trict, or be pre&#383;ent at any
Concert of Mu&#383;ick, Dancing or other Publick Diver&#383;ion
on the Evening next preceding the Lord's-Day,
on Pain of forfeiting ten Shillings for each
Offence, &amp;c."</p></div>

<p>Wardens were to be appointed in all the
towns and districts to see that these laws were
duly enforced. All existing laws on the Sabbath
were at that time repealed, but some of
the laws then passed are still in force.</p>

<p>Law against keeping barber's shops open
on Sunday morning in Salem in 1804:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
About 1804 your Selectmen ordered that after a
given date no barber's shop should be kept open on
Sunday morning. There was no appeal from their
mandate. The fatal last Sunday arrived; the customers
of the esteemed Benj. Blanchard, whose shop
was at the upper part of Essex street, opposite the
Endicott and Cabot mansions, came as usual to have
their hair tied; it was the epoch of queues, and it was
necessary to their aspect in church that their back
hair should be artistically bound with ribbon and their
heads nicely pomatumed, even though, like Bonaparte,
they shaved their own beards. This last Sunday it
was observable that each gentleman, in his turn, after
being barbered, instead of hurrying off as usual, resumed
his seat. As the second bell began to ring,
the last customer was accomplished, and the whole
company rose from their chairs, filed out into Essex
street, formed a line in front of Mr. Blanchard's shop,
and gave three rousing cheers; then, like Burns's
"Twa Dogs, each took off his several way," some to
Dr. Barnard's North Church, some to Dr. Hopkins's,
Dr. Bolles's, or Dr. Prince's First Church.</p>

<i>Columbian Centinel</i>, Nov. 27, 1816.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>From the "Essex Register," Salem, May 18,
1822, we learn that there had been trouble
caused by ill-bred young men congregating at
the public corners on Sunday evening, and also
that some females had behaved badly at that
time.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
One of those ill bred and riotous fellows, who have
become notorious for their bad conduct of late, at the
corners of our streets, was arrested by one of our
most vigilant constables, at the corner of North and
Essex streets, on Sunday evening last, carried before
a magistrate, committed to prison, and bound over
for his future good conduct. Our municipal authorities,
and all others concerned in bringing this person
to punishment, deserve the thanks of their fellow-citizens.
The town of Salem, once so distinguished
for the purity of its manners and the good order of
its society, has been disgraced of late, by outrages
upon the peace and quiet of the community, committed
by noisy assemblages of young men at the
public corners&mdash;and even <i>females</i> have been seen to
exhibit a demeanor in the streets disreputable to the
town, and disgraceful in the highest degree to themselves.
This conduct should receive not only the
discountenance, but the decided reprehension of the
respectable part of the community. Every citizen is
interested, and is moreover bound to manifest his
interest by his acts, in bringing every offender to
prompt and condign punishment. The stake which
every one has in the good order of the community, is
great&mdash;it behoves, then, every one to exert himself to
re-establish and preserve it.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>In 1819 in New York there were loud complaints
of the violation of the Sabbath, as we
see by an account taken from the "Salem
Gazette."</p>
<div class="blockquot"><p class="right"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
<span class="smtxt">NEW-YORK, JULY 14</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="lgtxt"><i>VIOLATION OF THE SABBATH.</i></span></p>

<p>A few weeks since, a meeting of the citizens was
called, to devise some efficient means to suppress the
violation of the Sabbath. A committee was appointed
to report a plan for that purpose. I wish to inquire
what that committee have done, and when another
meeting is to be called to receive their report.&mdash;The
evil still remains, and is certainly accumulating under
the most aggravated forms.&mdash;Our churches are nearly
deserted on the Sabbath, while every place of amusement
and pleasurable retreat is thronged. Good
authority states the numbers that frequent Brooklyn
every Sabbath, at from ten to twenty thousand, and a
proportionable number may be computed to visit
every other island and place of resort in the vicinity.
We have forty-five churches, and a population of one
hundred and twenty thousand; admitting one thousand
to attend each church, it follows that seventy-five
thousand violate that command of the Apostle
which requires Christians "not to forsake the assembling
of themselves together." Let the citizens
organize societies to suppress the violation of the
Sabbath and all other vice and immorality.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
"Sabbath-breakers" had multiplied to such
an extent in 1815 that conventions were held
in many of the counties in Massachusetts to
see what could be done in reference to the evil.
We have a report of the Essex convention at
Topsfield, Oct. 4, 1815. The Committee
say, among other things,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Although mo&#383;t men, even if they have no regard
for the Divine Being or the welfare of &#383;ociety, when
they know that Sabbath-breaking is offen&#383;ive to the
great body of the community, will, from regard to
them&#383;elves, refrain from it, yet there are &#383;ome abandoned
individuals, who are &#383;o lo&#383;t to all proper regard
even for them&#383;elves, as well as their Maker, and their
fellow-men, that in violation of laws, human and
Divine, and in direct oppo&#383;ition to the wi&#383;hes of the
community, they &#383;till continue to travel and labour
upon the Sabbath.</p>

<p>Such per&#383;ons ought <i>&#383;urely</i> to be pro&#383;ecuted, and
made to feel that they cannot violate the laws of the
Commonwealth, and profane the Sabbath with impunity.</p>

<p>If their conduct is &#383;uffered to continue, others will
be emboldened to follow their example; the evil will
again increa&#383;e, and eventually become as great as
before.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
But if they find that they cannot profane the Sabbath
without being &#383;ubjected to the trouble, &#383;hame
and expen&#383;e of a penal pro&#383;ecution, this enormous
evil, which has &#383;o long been undermining the be&#383;t
intere&#383;ts of the community, and drawing down upon
us Divine judgments, will be prevented. For pa&#383;t
experience has fully demon&#383;trated, that wherever the
laws are prudently, and at the &#383;ame time promptly
and faithfully executed, the evil will cea&#383;e.</p></div>

<p>And among the Resolves passed by the
Convention we find these,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>III. Re&#383;olved, that we earne&#383;tly recommend to
Tythingmen, Civil Officers and the friends of the
Sabbath in every town, to pro&#383;ecute, or cau&#383;e to be
pro&#383;ecuted, without di&#383;tinction and without delay, all,
who are travelling without &#383;ufficient rea&#383;on, or in any
way wilfully violating the laws re&#383;pecting the Lord's
Day.</p>

<p>V. Re&#383;olved, that we recommend to all the
friends of order, to circulate as exten&#383;ively as po&#383;&#383;ible,
&#383;uch tracts and pamphlets as are calculated to promote
the due ob&#383;ervance of the Lord's Day.</p>

<p>Voted, that the Clerk be reque&#383;ted to &#383;end a copy
of the doings of the Convention, to the Editors of
the public papers in Bo&#383;ton, Salem, Newburyport and
Haverhill, and that they be reque&#383;ted to publi&#383;h the
&#383;ame in their re&#383;pective papers.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
A full account of this convention can be
found in the "Salem Gazette," Oct. 31, 1815.
It does not appear that there was any disturbance
of public worship to complain of,
only many people neglected to attend the
meetings, or walked or rode for pleasure on
the Lord's Day.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>In the same month and year the "Worcester
&AElig;gis" gave expression to opinions on the
question of "Sabbath-breaking" which we
think accord more with modern ideas than do
those of the Essex convention. The views
of the "&AElig;gis" probably represented the average
liberal sentiment of that day.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="right"><span class="smtxt"><i>WORCESTER, OCT. 25.</i></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>BREACH OF THE SABBATH.</i></p>

<p>At the late &#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of the S.J. Court at Northampton
it was decided that a ju&#383;tice of the peace could
not i&#383;&#383;ue a warrant for a breach of the Sunday laws
again&#383;t an offender that is not an inhabitant of the
county where the offence is committed, but that he
mu&#383;t be pro&#383;ecuted only before a grand jury; and that
ju&#383;tices of the peace could not i&#383;&#383;ue warrants, nor
&#383;heriffs &#383;erve them, on the Lord's day, for any
breaches of tho&#383;e laws. Damages were awarded
again&#383;t a ju&#383;tice, a tythingman, and a &#383;heriff, upon the
latter principle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
Upon this deci&#383;ion we congratulate the public. It
has taken a formidable weapon from the hands of
tho&#383;e petty tyrants, who are labouring to revive the
reign of religious per&#383;ecution. We tru&#383;t we &#383;hall no
longer &#383;ee the Sabbath tre&#383;pa&#383;&#383;ed upon by the&#383;e <i>official
harpies</i>, who, in&#383;tead of &#383;pending the day as they
ought, in wor&#383;hiping God, confe&#383;&#383;ing their own manifold
&#383;ins, and praying that they may be endued with a
more chri&#383;tian temper, are riding or walking the
highway, "&#383;eeking whom they may devour," and
gratifying at once their malice and their avarice, by
plundering their fellow-citizens, and filling their own
pockets. In &#383;ome towns they have been &#383;tationed at
every turn of the road, ready to dart out upon the
traveller, like a &#383;pider from the corner of his web.
We rejoice at every occurrence which checks this
per&#383;ecuting &#383;pirit.&mdash;Tho&#383;e who know us, know that
we re&#383;pect the Sabbath and its holy in&#383;titutions: for
this very rea&#383;on we reprobate conduct which has a
direct tendency to bring the&#383;e in&#383;titutions into contempt.
In all ages, the <i>anti-chri&#383;tian &#383;pirit</i> of <i>chri&#383;tian
profe&#383;&#383;ors</i> has done more injury to the cau&#383;e of religion,
than the attacks of its declared enemies. Real
Chri&#383;tianity cannot flouri&#383;h by per&#383;ecution. Exce&#383;&#383;ive
rigour defeats the very purpo&#383;es it is intended to
&#383;ub&#383;erve. In time there will be a re-action, and men
will go to the oppo&#383;ite extreme&mdash;religion and morals
will be as much too lax, as they were before too
&#383;trict.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>
In no part of the world is the &#383;abbath &#383;o &#383;crupulou&#383;ly
ob&#383;erved as in <i>New-England</i>. As we keep
it, it re&#383;embles more the <i>Jewi&#383;h Sabbath</i>, than the
Sabbath of all other parts of Chri&#383;tendom. We had
much rather &#383;ee this nice punctiliou&#383;ne&#383;s, than that
indifference which prevails in &#383;ome places. But we
think there is &#383;uch a thing as <i>drawing the cord too tight</i>&mdash;&#383;o
tight that it will be in danger of &#383;napping in
&#383;under! The good habits of our countrymen, and
the increa&#383;ing regard which is entertained for religion,
will be a &#383;ure guaranty of the re&#383;pectful observance of
the Sabbath. There are very few men in the community,
who dare to outrage public feeling by a
wanton violation of the &#383;olemnity of the day. We
have excellent laws to puni&#383;h tho&#383;e who di&#383;turb the
devotions of any &#383;ociety or individual. Let the&#383;e
laws be put in execution without fear, favour or
affection. But for the re&#383;t, let religion take care
of it&#383;elf&mdash;it needs no a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance from the feeble arm
of the magi&#383;trate.</p></div>

<span class="smcap">The Sabbath</span>. An ecclesiastical council was
lately convened at Kingsbury, N. York, to decide a
controversy which had originated between the minority
and majority of the Baptist Church, in Kingsbury,
respecting an observance of the Christian Sabbath.
One of the Elders of the Church, Mr. Culver,
had written, preached and published a discourse,
which, in the opinion of the Council, amounted
to a full and complete denial of all Scriptural authority,
for observing a day as a Christian Sabbath. The
Council, after stating the reasons, which in their
opinion, conclusively proved the obligation of the
Christian to observe the Sabbath, recommend an
union between the parties to this controversy, and
if the majority do not comply, the Council deem it
their imperious duty, to recognize the minority as the
regular Baptist Church.</p>

<p>In a former paper, we alluded to the manner in
which the Sabbath was regarded by our ancestors.
It appears, that the following special instructions on

In the "Salem Register" of Oct. 11, 1820,
we find the report of the trial of a man charged
with the crime of Sabbath-breaking by delivering
milk to his customers. The presiding
judge (Mitchell) seems to have made a very
sensible address to the jury on this occasion.
Probably the surest way to bring about speedily
the much-dreaded "European Sunday" would
be for some person or persons to prosecute
such individuals as they happen to know who
violate certain obsolete Sunday laws.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Commonwealth vs. Glover</span>.</p>

<p>This was an appealed case. The justice before
whom it was originally tried, imposed a fine on Glover,
who appealed to the Common Pleas. It was tried at
Dedham on the 21st ult.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
The complaint was that said Glover had been
guilty of the crime of Sabbath breaking, by delivering
milk to his customers in Boston on the 25th June
last. The evidence to support the complaint was
from two gentlemen, Messrs. M'Clure and Vose.
They testified, that on the 25th June last they walked
out in company at 5, A.M. to see if they could discover
any persons delivering milk from carts&mdash;that
they had not been long in pursuit, before they descried
a man, who descended from his vehicle, with a milk
vessel, and poured milk from it, which he delivered
to a family in their presence.&mdash;They approached him&mdash;enquired
his name, and from whence he came.
He answered, from Quincy, and his name was
Glover.&mdash;They asked if he was in the habit of bringing
milk to Boston on the Sabbath. He told them he
had been when the weather was very hot. This was
the evidence.</p>

<p>The complaint being for doing labour on the Sabbath
in the county of Norfolk, which was not labour
of <i>necessity</i> or <i>mercy</i>.</p>

<p>Churchill, for Defendant, in cross examining the
witnesses, enquired why they rose at so early an hour,
on the 25th June, and went to walk? They answered
that it was partly to exercise, and partly to
perform their duty as professors of religion. They
said they had made up their minds that the moiety
of the fines they expected to receive, they would
give to some charitable institution.</p>

<p>The defence rested on two points&mdash;<i>First</i>, That no
crime or act was proved to have been committed in
Norfolk county&mdash;<i>Secondly</i>, If it should be proved that
the act complained of had been committed, it was an
act of <i>necessity</i> and <i>mercy</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
Counsellor Churchill entered with much spirit into
the cause, and evinced that he had bestowed upon
it much thought and labour. He gave an elaborate
history of the Sabbatical Institution, and stated the
various opinions and laws as to the division of holy
time. He said that many families in Boston, both
poor and rich, depended on milk to feed their children&mdash;that
a large proportion of the people had no conveniences
for keeping it from Saturday night till
Monday morning; that those who had no other way
of disposing of their milk, but by delivering it to those
who would suffer without it, performed an act embracing
both <i>necessity</i> and <i>mercy</i>; that those who sat
up all night for the purpose of being up before day,
to fatten on those who were performing the before-named
charitable act, were like the Jews of old, who,
when the Saviour of mankind raised the dead and
restored the blind to sight, cried out, Crucify him!
the Jews were but the M'Clures of the present day.</p>

<p>The Judge (<span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>) charged the jury, that, if
they had doubts whether any offence were proved to
have been committed, within the county, they must
acquit; or, if otherwise, and they were of opinion
that it was necessary to deal out milk on the Sabbath
in extreme hot weather, they must acquit. He stated
that his neighbours bought milk of him, and took it
on Sunday as on other days, and thought it no crime.
He did not cast up the score, receive the money and
rub out the chalks on that day; but apprehended that
his conduct was virtually the same as that charged
upon the defendant. The defendant pursued his
regular course, and in doing so, he saved his property
from waste, and relieved many from disappointment
and distress. The clergy ride from town to town on
the Sabbath, and the physicians ride without molestation.
The Sabbath is a day of rest&mdash;but in the exercise
of its duties, reason is to be regarded. Such
worldly concerns as can well be done on other days,
ought not to be done on the Sabbath&mdash;but if an ox
fall into a pit, he must be taken out; that if a clergyman
has agreed to exchange with a brother, he may
as well ride a few miles on the Sabbath as to make a
parade of going on Saturday night.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
The jury returned a verdict of&mdash;NOT GUILTY.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p><span class="smcap">Observance of the Sabbath.</span> There has been
lately, in some of the Boston papers, a discussion of
the question, whether the sailing of a steam boat on
the Sabbath is not a profanation.</p>

<p>We allude to this subject, at the present time, not
for the purpose of taking a side in the controversy,
but merely to show in what manner this day was
formerly noticed in England, and our own country.</p>

<p>In England, during the reign of James the first, it
was lawful for his subjects to indulge in certain sports,
such as dancing, archery, leaping, vaulting, may-games,
whitsun ales, and morris dances, on <i>Sunday</i>
after evening service. But it was not lawful to have
bear-baiting, bull-baiting, interludes, and bowling.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
In reign of Charles 1st a statute was passed, prohibiting
a meeting out of the parish, on the Lord's
day, to enjoy these sports. A statute was afterwards
passed, prohibiting carriers and drovers from travelling,
and butchers from slaughtering or selling on
this day. Afterwards all tradesmen, artificers, workmen,
laborers, or other persons, were prohibited from
exercising their callings on this day, excepting works
of necessity and charity, and dressing and selling
meat in families, inns, cook-shops, &amp;c. selling milk
before nine in the morning, and after four in the
afternoon, <i>selling mackerell</i> before or after divine service,
and excepting also forty watermen, who may
ply between Vauxhall and Limehouse.</p>

<p>By a statute of George 2d fish carriages were
allowed to pass on Sundays, whether laden or empty.
During the reign of this King, the Court decided in
favor of a Baker, charged "with baking puddings and
pies on the Lord's day for dinner." The court considered
the case as falling within the exceptions of
works of necessity and charity. "That it was better
that one baker and his men should stay at home,
than many families and servants." Under George
3d Bakers were prohibited from making, baking or
selling, excepting between nine in the morning and
one in the afternoon, and the person requiring the
baking carried or sent it to the place where it was to
be baked. A law was afterwards passed, permitting
bakers to work, so far as may be necessary in setting
or superintending the sponge, to prepare the dough
for the next day's baking.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
The provisions of the Colony and Province laws,
on this subject, were embodied in our State law of
1792, which prohibits every person from keeping
open his shop, ware-house, or work-house, on the
Lord's day, &amp; from doing any labor or work, excepting
that of necessity and charity, and from attending
concerts of music, dancing, &amp;c. It likewise prohibits
travelling by drovers, teamsters, &amp;c. visiting
taverns, &amp;c. during the time included between the
midnight preceding and the sun-setting of the Lord's
day. It likewise prohibits games, diversions, recreations
on the land or water, on the evening next preceding
or succeeding the Lord's day. Under the
Colonial government, it was for some time made a
question when the Sabbath should be considered as
commencing; but in 1645 it became a custom to
regard the evening of the last day of the week as the
beginning of the Sabbath. Several clergymen however
considered Saturday afternoon as the commencement
of holy time.</p>

<p>The following extracts from our town records will
show in what manner the Sabbath was observed by
our pious ancestors.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">"1644.</p>

<p>"Ordered, that twoe be appointed every Lord's day, to
walk forth in the time of God's worshippe, to tak notice of
such as either lye about the meeting-house, without attending
to the word or ordinances, or that lye at home, or in the
fields, without giving good account thereof, and to tak the
names of such persons, and to present them to the magistrate,
whereby they may be accordingly proceeded against."</p>

<p class="center">"1677.</p>

"Whereas, there hath been several complaints of several

Selectmen have agreed each of them to take their turns, with
the constables to walk abroad on the Lord's day, both forenoon
and afternoone, morning and evening, to redress such
miscarriages as they shall at any time meet withal."</p></div>

<p>But the following license granted by the selectmen
in 1672, shows a much greater liberality than is exhibited
in these days.</p>

<p>The interest, which is now felt in the subject of
the Sabbath, renders the following article, respecting
the curiosity of Le Sage, worthy the attention of the
reader. It was extracted from a review of Le Sage,
published in Scotland about twelve years ago.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
"At the time we are now speaking of the Sabbath was
observed at Geneva, with a gloom and austerity of which we,
in Scotland can probably form a more correct notion than the
inhabitants of any other country in Christendom. Le Sage
felt some curiosity to know whether the author of Nature
still continued to impose on himself the same law that originally
marked the institution of the day of rest. It would have
puzzled the first philosopher in Europe to think of any
method by which this question could be brought to the decision
of experiment: but the ingenuity of our young enquirer
soon suggested an experiment.&mdash;He measured, with
great care, the increase of a plant day after day, in order to
discover whether it would cease growing on the Sabbath.
The result could not fail to solve the difficulty, and to convince
the young man, that though the work of Creation might
terminate, the work of Providence is never interrupted."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Sunday in Salem in 1838.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smtxt">SALEM AND THE SABBATH</span>.</p>

<p>On our way to church in the quiet city of Salem
recently, a stranger overtook us, and inquired where
the Rev. Mr. W&mdash;&mdash; was to preach that morning?
We answered that we were going to his church, and
would show him a seat. For which he expressed his
thanks and immediately remarked, that he had travelled
recently nearly over all our country, and nowhere
had he witnessed such entire abandonment of
all secular avocations on the Sabbath. It seemed
like a different country, and made him feel the significance
of the name of that ancient town&mdash;Salem,
City of Peace.&mdash;<i>Christian (Boston) Monitor</i>.</p></div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
Fifty years ago hardly any one thought of
absenting himself or herself from public worship.
People went to church as a matter of
course, partly from a sense of duty, and partly
from habit; and this is still the case to some
extent. The majority of thoughtful persons of
all religious persuasions are agreed upon one
point, and that is, it is desirable to have Sunday
set apart as a day of rest and change from
the ordinary cares and business of life. From
a sanitary point of view this rest is no doubt
of the highest importance. All people, moreover,
who desire to have quiet for religious
worship should at least not be disturbed. Public
opinion ought to be protection enough;
but unfortunately it might not be, so that
laws to such an extent as is necessary for this
purpose should be in force. But the idea
entertained by certain fanatics, that no one
should walk or ride for health and recreation,
or even engage in any innocent occupation,
on Sunday, is so absurd as not to deserve a
moment's consideration.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>In 1829 a futile attempt was made to put a
stop to the delivery of Sunday mails, one result
of which was the holding of a number of public
meetings in Salem, the reports of which we
take from the papers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
Meetings were also held in Boston and New
York.</p>
<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">PUBLIC MEETING.</p>

<p>At a very numerous and respectable meeting of the
citizens of Salem, "<i>opposed to Legislative interference

Kittredge,</span> appointed Secretary.&mdash;The object
of the meeting having been stated by the Chairman,
it was</p>

<p><i>Voted</i>, That Messrs. George Cleveland, Leverett
Saltonstall, Stephen C. Phillips, John W. Treadwell,
Perley Putnam, Nath'l West, jun., Franklin H. Story,
John Crowninshield, Jos. G. Waters, Charles A.
Andrew, David Pingree, and David A. Neal, be a
committee<a name="FNanchor_2_3" id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> to consider and report at an adjournment
of the meeting, what measures it is expedient to take
for the purpose of carrying into effect the objects of
the meeting.</p>

and Universalists.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>At the adjourned meeting on Saturday evening Jan.
3, 1829, the Committee reported the following Resolutions,
which were unanimously adopted:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
<i>Resolved</i>, That the observance of Sunday as a
day of religious worship and instruction is eminently
adapted to extend the knowledge and influence of
truth and virtue, and thus to improve the character
and increase the happiness of individuals and of the
community.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That under no circumstances has religion
excited such general interest, as when, not rendered
odious by legal restraints, it has addressed its claims
for support to the understandings and consciences of
men.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That a "<i>system of regulations</i>" for the purpose
of enforcing religious observances is opposed to
the principles of religious liberty and to our form of
civil government; and it is to be feared that any
attempts to introduce such regulations will re-act in
consequences detrimental to the interests which it
may have been intended to promote.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That neither the precepts of Christianity
nor the design of religious observances are incompatible
with the prompt and faithful discharge of the
various duties which belong to our social and civil relations;
and the urgency of such duties may frequently
render it of importance to every individual to receive
or transmit intelligence with the least possible delay.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
<i>Resolved</i>, That for the necessary accommodation of
the Government and citizens of this widely extended
country, an arrangement of the mails, by which letters
and packages are forwarded and delivered with the
utmost despatch and safety, has been for a great length
of time maintained under the vigilant superintendence
of the Postmaster General; and such arrangement,
while it is productive of innumerable advantages to
the Government and to the citizens, is not allowed
to interfere with the public religious services on
Sunday.<a name="FNanchor_B_4" id="FNanchor_B_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_4" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That any change in the present arrangement
of the mails which shall have the effect to subject
to increased delay and hazard the communication
between distant parts of the country is impolitic; and
if authorized by Congress for the sole purpose of enforcing
religious observances, will be an exercise of
power for the accomplishment of an object not recognized
by the Constitution, and contrary to its spirit
and the intentions of its framers.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That if Congress should prohibit the forwarding
of mails and the delivery of letters on Sunday,
individuals and the Government will be obliged to
resort to such temporary arrangements for transmitting
intelligence as their respective exigencies may
require; and such temporary arrangements, while
they will be attended with increased expense, will be
productive of far greater inconvenience and disturbance
to the religious public, than can justly be complained
of under the present system.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
<i>Resolved</i>, That a committee be appointed, who
shall be instructed to prepare a memorial to Congress
expressive of the views of this meeting, whenever in
their opinion, circumstances shall render it expedient
to present such memorial; and such memorial shall
be submitted by them for approbation, at a meeting
to be called for that purpose.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the committee appointed in conformity
to the foregoing resolution, shall be authorized
to call future meetings, to correspond with citizens
of other towns, and generally to take such measures
as they may deem expedient for the purpose of carrying
into effect the objects of this meeting.</p>

<p>The following gentlemen were appointed a committee
to perform the duties specified in the two last
resolutions, viz. George Cleveland, Dudley L. Pickman,
Willard Peele, Perley Putnam, Philip Chase,
Stephen White, Gideon Tucker, Nath'l Frothingham,
Stephen C. Phillips. The Committee was authorized
to fill any vacancies that may occur in their number.</p>

<p><i>Voted</i>, That an attested copy of the proceedings be
published in the several newspapers in this town, and
in one or more of the newspapers in the city of
Washington, and that an attested copy be also forwarded
to the Post Master General.</p>

<p>The meeting was then dissolved.</p>

<p><i>To the Hon. Richard M. Johnson, Chairman of the
Committee on the Post Office and Post Roads, Washington.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:&mdash;The subscribers, a committee appointed at
a meeting of the inhabitants of this town, on the 3d
January last, to take such measures as they may deem

with pleasure the report of the Committee of the
Senate on that subject.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
Previous to receiving that report, they were about
petitioning Congress&mdash;and the public sentiment in
this place is so universal against an interference for
religious reasons, that a very respectable and numerous
subscription could readily have been obtained.&mdash;But
the report from the Senate represented the subject
in so powerful a light&mdash;demonstrated so clearly the
want of power in the government to legislate for the
reasons given by the petitioners, and showed so conclusively,
that if they had the power, they certainly
had not the ability to determine for all the people of
the United States, what God's law was&mdash;that we
have concluded it would not be necessary at the present
session of Congress to take any further steps in
the business. We have thought, however, that tho'
constituting but a small part of the United States, yet
it might not be uninteresting to the committee, to
know how much in accordance with our views are
the sentiments expressed in their report and to assure
them for ourselves, and those whom we represent,
that we shall at all times consider them engaged in
the highest and most momentous acts of legislation,
whenever their efforts shall tend to prevent an interference
of the religious with the civil power&mdash;all
union between church and state&mdash;all attempts of religious
zealots to enforce by law, what <i>they</i> may term
divine truth.</p>

<p>You will please to convey to the gentlemen of the

yourself, sir, accept the assurance of our respectful
consideration.</p>

The following item is from the "Observer"
of Jan. 21, 1829:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">The Report of the Senate on the Sunday
Mails</span>. The Portsmouth Advertiser has attacked
this Report, "tooth and nail," imputing to it an influence
as disastrous as that which attends the writings
of Tom Paine or Citizen Brisset. The writer
states, that the Senate by adopting it, "has virtually
declared, that the laws of Almighty God are no rule
for human legislation." We will give one more
extract from these remarks, to enable our readers to
form a judgment of the writer's character. He must
certainly belong to that unfortunate class of the community,
for whom "strait-jackets and a spare diet,"
are usually prescribed.</p>

<p>The following account of a Parisian Sabbath
we find in the "Salem Observer" of 1830:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Parisian Sabbath</span>. There is little in the appearance
of Paris on a Sabbath morning to remind us that
it is a day of rest; the markets are thronged as on
other days, carts and drays and all sorts of vehicles,
designed for the transportation of merchandise are in
motion; buying and selling and manual labor proceed
as usual; there is rest for neither man nor beast. In
the afternoon the shops are usually closed; and labor
is suspended, and the remainder of the day is devoted
to pleasure. Few of those who go to church appear
to have any other motive than amusement. They
walk about the aisles, gazing at the pictures, and
listening to the solemn music of the mass and go
away when they are tired. Those whom I have seen
really engaged in worship appeared to belong to the
lower classes; and with the exception of those few,
the persons you see in church are merely idle spectators,
attracted thither by curiosity, or to pass an idle
half hour before they go to promenade in the gardens.<br />

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Sunday Mails.</span> The following resolution on

<p>A great change has taken place in some of
our towns within a few years in reference to
the Sunday mail. Twenty-five years ago it
was rare to see a person belonging to one of
the Evangelical sects at the post-office at the
time of the opening of the mail on Sunday
noon; whereas now it is not uncommon to see
deacons and numerous other members of such
churches hurry from their several places of
worship to get their letters and papers with as
much eagerness as "heretics." Sunday papers
moreover are now bought by the same class.
The same change too is observable in the use
of horse-cars on Sunday. Few men are governed
by the conscientious scruples once held
about riding to and from church, especially if
the day happens to be hot or stormy. This
may or may not be an improvement; it depends
upon the point of view from which we look
at it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
One of the most radical men we ever knew,
one who thought "Sunday should be abolished"
and a "new Bible made by men of
modern ideas, and reasonable views introduced,
and the old one discarded," said he was
brought to these views by having been forced
when young to attend church and engage in
religious exercises, and told that he must conform
to the established belief and never ask
any questions. It will be said that this man
was an exception to the general rule. Perhaps
so, for one taking such an extreme view; but
we must all know cases somewhat similar. A
careful inquiry will show that if we look around
among the clergy even, we shall find that the
most radical preachers of the day were brought
up in the Orthodox ranks. Who would wish
to re-establish the gloomy Puritan Sabbath,
with its barren meeting-house, without fires or
music, and its tedious, uninteresting sermon,
running on to "fifteenthly," gauged by an
hour-glass turned over perhaps once or twice
during the discourse?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
Speaking of the change of habits in New
England, even, it is noticeable how much more
prevalent colds and other slight indispositions
are now to what they used to be on Sunday.
The very thought of going to church makes
some people cough or have a headache.
Theatres or concerts never seem to affect these
people in the same way. Even the weather,
which keeps people in-doors on Sunday, never
keeps them in on other days.</p>

<p>Our own view of the subject is that while
we should be glad to see more interest taken
in public worship than there is at present, we
think people should have the right of spending
their Sundays in their own way,&mdash;always, of
course, provided they do not interfere with the
rights and feelings of others. It seems to us
that the only way to have Sunday properly
observed is for those who are influential to
make some little personal sacrifices, if need be,
to attend the Sunday services, and do all they
can to promote the most cheerful views of religion
and make the services interesting.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
Let those people who lament the decay of
religious observances read the following quotation
from the "Salem Gazette" of 1830.
Those who can recollect how it was at that date
must see that notwithstanding a perhaps much
smaller attendance now upon public worship,
there is every reason to believe that, at least as
far as the native population is concerned, Sunday
is really more quiet than it was then. After
reading this article we shall perhaps be prepared
to say that "tythingmen" may have
been needed just after the Revolution.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">The Times we live in.</span> The dreadful tragedy
performed in this town last April, and the subsequent
arrests, developments, confessions, trials, &amp;c., by
keeping the thoughts and conversation of the community
continually directed to that enormity, have
led to the general but very erroneous notion, that
there must have been a great deterioration of the
public morals.&mdash;If the words of the aged are to be
received as true, the very reverse is the fact. The
revolutionary war left the whole country as well depraved
in morals as exhausted in resources. This
was particularly the case with such towns as Salem,
which had been largely exposed to the irresistibly
corrupting influence of privateering.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
At that time, when the population of Salem was
not half so great as it is at present, more riot, debauchery,
and vice, obtruded themselves upon the sight
in a week, than could now be discovered by diligent
search in a month. The corruption of manners was
so general, that almost none escaped from its contaminating
influence. Mechanics and other laboring
men would leave their business in the day, and their
families in the evening, to spend their time, dancing
and drinking, in the dens of pollution which then
abounded in "Naugus-Hole" and "Button-Hole."
Merchants, professional men, &amp;c. passed a great part
of their time in taverns, drinking and gambling.
Quarrelling and fighting there were not uncommon,
and well-worn packs of cards were always lying about
the bar-room tables, (though seldom long unemployed,)
ready for the use of visitors,&mdash;the common
game on these occasions being All-Fours, and the
common stake a bowl of punch or a mug of flip. Pastimes
like the above named, were current in every
class of society. When the regular hours of drinking
approached, the workmen left their labour to play at
cards, the loser "treating the shop's crew." In a
large establishment a boy would be kept running with
his jug nearly the whole time, the contents being
freely shared amongst master, journeymen, boys, and
numerous visitors.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
At this time, and long afterward, infamous houses
were kept open day and night, in the quarters of the
town named in the preceding paragraph. The fiddles
were kept in constant motion, and if any thought of
stopping them they did not dare to attempt it. The
most flagrant disorders and outrages were continually
occurring, so that a timid man would go far out of
his way to avoid passing near those places. The
churches on Sunday were not nearly so well attended
as they now are. The proportion of persons who
made the Sabbath a day of recreation, was much
greater. The time was spent in riding into the
country, walking about the fields and pastures, and
visiting friends in town. But little order was preserved
in the streets on that day. People in passing
to meeting thro' Prison Lane, (as County-street was
then called) and its environs, encountered frequent
and large groups of men and boys, noisily engaged in
gambling with props, pitching coppers, &amp;c. occasionally
enlivened by the uproar of a quarrel.</p>

<p>The doctrines of Tom Paine and his French coadjutors,
were much more in vogue then than now.
Infidelity stalked over the land with a giant stride, to
which the mincing pace of the fooleries of Fanny
Wright can bear no comparison; and virtue and good
order were almost put out of countenance. Intemperance,
habitual or occasional, was so common, as to
be hardly considered a matter of reproach; and the
kindred vices abounded, which usually follow in its
train.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>
The state of society has been continually improving
since. The bad habits of that time have been
discarded one after another, by all who would maintain
a reputable standing; and open immorality now
places a man at once in the lowest rank of society. Intemperance
has been diminished in a surprising degree.
Debauchery has been compelled to retreat to lurking
holes and corners, instead of obtruding its "horrid
front" to the public gaze. Education has been improved,
and universally diffused; and public worship
is more generally attended.&mdash;Terrible crimes have
indeed been committed amongst us, and may be
again, but the habits and manners which lead to
crime, are less prevalent at the present time than
they have been for fifty years before.</p></div>

<p>It seems to us to be clearly a mistake for
those of ultra-liberal notions to suppose that
all who cannot assent to their views of Sunday
must of necessity be either Pharisees or hypocrites,&mdash;quite
as great a mistake as that of the
ultra-conservatives, who condemn as wicked
all who do not believe in a puritanical observance
of Sunday.</p>

<p>Whatever we may think or say or do, people
nowadays will not be forced to attend church.
Among all denominations the services are more
attractive than they once were, and every year
there is less and less of the repulsive kinds of
doctrine preached. But in spite of this, while
many men regard attendance on divine service
as both a pleasure and a privilege, there are
others, and they not few, whom no influence
or persuasion can induce to attend Sunday
worship. Such persons must be left to spend
the day as they please.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
A very large proportion of those who do
not attend church services are people of culture
and character, from whom church-goers have
nothing to fear as regards a disturbance of
their worship. Generally this class are interested
in having Sunday kept as a day of quiet
and rest, and their non-attendance at church
is no evidence that they have any desire to
secularize Sunday.</p>

<p>An eminent writer has said: "We live in a
transition period, when the old faiths which
comforted nations, and not only so, but made
nations, seem to have spent their force....
There is faith in chemistry, in meat and
wine, in wealth, in machinery, in the steam-engine,
galvanic battery, turbine-wheels, sewing-machines,
and in public opinion; but not
in divine causes.... A silent revolution has
loosed the tension of the old religious sects,
and in place of the gravity and permanence of
those societies of opinion, they run into freak
and extravagance.... In creeds never was
such levity: witness the heathenisms in Christianity,&mdash;the
periodic revivals, the millennium
mathematics, the peacock ritualism, the retrogression
to popery, the maundering of Mormons,
the squalor of mesmerism, the deliration
of rappings, the rat-and-mouse revelation,
thumps in table-drawers, and black art ... By
the irresistible maturing of the general mind
the Christian traditions have lost their hold."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
If these statements are true, we have a sufficient
answer to the question so often asked:
"Why do not people go to church as they once
did?" They do not go because they have
lost their faith in churches and worship,&mdash;at
least such have as are appealed to from those
holding liberal and reasonable views. There
are no doubt men who consider the too often
expensive ways in which churches are supported
as altogether beyond their means. The
demands of civilization upon individuals in
these restless times, when there are so many
organizations, secret, secular, and religious, are
indeed too great for small incomes, especially
as the cost of food is continually increasing,
and as society in other ways makes so many
secular demands upon them. Public worship
is after all, in the view of many persons, not a
necessity, but only a luxury which can easily
be dispensed with. It might perhaps have
been better for the whole community if churches
had undertaken to do the work which is now
in the hands of many charitable and secret
societies; then those who take so much interest
in these outside, often expensive, organizations
would have had all their interest in the
churches. But the latter were for years so
divided on doctrines of belief that their whole
attention has for the most part been directed to
other matters than their legitimate work, which
has thus been thrown into the hands of outside
agencies. In these times it seems difficult
to maintain religious societies except where the
element of fear is dominant in the creed, where
some remarkable preacher takes the attention,
or where the ritual or fashion attracts. Do not
the papers often speak of "fashionable"
churches?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
One thing which prevents many people
from attending public worship on Sunday is
the increasing tendency towards ritualism,&mdash;or
perhaps, we should say, making the services less
instructive than formerly, and more devotional
or emotional. This is seen not only in the
Episcopal Church, but also among many other
denominations. Even Congregational Orthodox&mdash;descendants
of the Pilgrim Fathers&mdash;introduce
prayer-books and responsive services,
and make their church buildings more ecclesiastical
in appearance, to look as much as possible
like Episcopal churches. All these things to
many minds are not edifying, to say the least,
and consequently such persons absent themselves
from service. Those too who are
impressed by emotional religion join the
Episcopalians, so that for the time there is an
apparent increase in the attendance at the
Episcopal churches, gained from churches of
other denominations; and especially too as
fashion decrees nowadays that "it is the proper
thing to do" to go to the Episcopal Church,
whether you believe in its doctrines or not.
So that at length there are a great many
people who think when church-going gets to
be a matter of fashion, there is quite as much
real religion to be found outside as inside the
church; consequently they lose their interest.
All these causes must be taken together; of
course no one thing alone accounts for the
change in regard to church attendance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
We quote the following remarks from a
recent English paper ("The Unitarian Herald");
they have a direct bearing on our subject,
and are worthy of consideration by those
who neglect public worship or favor a more
secular Sunday. Among other things, the
speaker (the Rev. John Page Hopps) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
"So far as we can see, the old orthodox believers
were right when they called public worship 'a means
of grace;' and if human experience is of any value,
it is an undoubted fact that a great multitude which
no man could number <i>have</i> felt the grace-giving influence
of it. It is as true as ever that man cannot
'live by bread alone,' but that he needs also the
'word that proceedeth from the mouth of God;'
and if it is true, as we believe, that the word of God
does come home with special force and pathos when
worship is joined in by kindred souls, the argument
for public worship, from this point of view, seems
complete. And yet, half in jest and half in earnest,
and sometimes altogether in earnest, we hear it said
that a man can worship God in the fields quite as
well as in the church. 'Perhaps he can,' said a
wise man once, 'but <i>does</i> he?' I wonder whether
we shall go on in this direction until we hear it said
that a man can worship God playing at lawn-tennis
as in attending public worship? Thus there may
actually come into existence a cant of the absentee
which shall be as really cant as the cant of the
devotee; for the use of the word 'worship' in such
instances is a glaring case of exaggeration tinged
with self-deception, which is the very essence of cant.
Besides, one of the surest notes of the worshipping
spirit is an increase of sympathy and love,&mdash;sympathy
that suggests fellowship, and love that suggests anything
but selfish isolation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
"The irregularity also of attendance upon public
worship might be cited as an instance of neglect
or levity which 'personal consecration' alone can
cure. In days gone by, attendance upon public
worship was a habit, and nothing that could be
avoided was allowed to interfere with it. Twice on
the Sunday, too, was the rule, and not, as now, the
decided exception. But with many it is now becoming
once every other Sunday, or scarcely that;
with so little of 'personal consecration' in the
matter that the need for an umbrella may decide the
doubter not to go.</p>

<p>"Do we not, again, listen too much merely for delight?
and does not the question, 'How did you like
the sermon,' or 'How did you like the service,'
indicate that we join in the service and listen to a
sermon in an entirely wrong spirit? The critical
or self-regarding spirit has its uses, but it may be
fatal to 'personal consecration' in public worship.
How often does an entire service depend upon our
own temper, our own mood, our own spirit? And
how often is it true that a congregation has as much
to do with the making of a minister as the minister
has to do with the making of a congregation?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
"'If I neglect public worship, then,' a man should
say to himself, 'the community is injured, the brotherhood
is weakened, the young are confused. It is a
grave responsibility.'</p>

<p>"But now we must not shrink from the question:
How far or how long ought these considerations to
hold the man who has lost delight in public worship
or faith in that to which it bears witness? When
should doubt make worship impossible, or unbelief
make worship wrong for the honest soul? When
should 'personal consecration' say to a man, not
<i>stay</i>, but <i>depart</i>? It is a grave question, and every
one must shape his answer for himself. All I would
say is: Give worship the benefit of the doubt: ay!
give fellow-worshippers the benefit of the doubt.
Continue with them as long as you can; if not as a
full believer, then as a devout inquirer, a gentle seeker,
a sympathetic friend. Why not? That is possible
with us; for the very bond of our union is sympathetic
regard for one another's freedom. It is also
specially possible with us because our teachings do
not, at all events, outrage the reason and shock the
moral sense. Even an agnostic might listen to us
and hope that our Gospel is true.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
"Special dangers call for special safeguards, special
consideration, special wariness. It is an age of
splendid advance in science, of restless energy in
business, of stupendous activity in politics, of daring
questioning everywhere. All that makes against
public worship; and yet all that makes public worship
a greater necessity and demonstrates 'the pressing
need of personal consecration' to it. God only
knows what we should do without it and the blessed
Sunday!</p></div>

<p>In conclusion, let us add to the above
speech the following remarks, which we
heartily approve,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Mr. Preston (London) testified to the falling off
of attendance at public worship, and he attributed
this largely to the parents not taking their children
with them in early years, as of old times. He deprecated
the going to public worship to have the
brains tickled in hearing a particular man, and maintained
that this was in no sense 'public worship.'
He emphasized strongly the fact that those who say
they can worship in the fields do not, in fact, worship
at all. He urged that in worship the musical and
devotional services should become more prominent,
and the sermon become frequently but subsidiary."</p></div>

<p><i>CHRISTIAN SYMBOLS AND STORIES OF THE
SAINTS.</i> By <span class="smcap">Clara Erksine Clement</span>. Assisted by <span class="smcap">Katherine E. Conway</span>.
1 vol. Large 12mo., with many full page illustrations. $2.50.</p>

<p>This is a revised version of the greater part of the author's "Hand-book
of Legendary Art,"&mdash;of which seventeen large editions have been exhausted.
The clear and beautiful explanation of the expressive symbols
by which men's minds are helped to reverent contemplation of the mysteries
of revealed religion, leaves nothing to be desired. The "Stories of the
Saints" will be illustrated by numerous full page engravings from the
rarest and finest works of the great masters of Christian Art&mdash;prominence
being given to scenes from the life of the Blessed Virgin, and pictures of the
Evangelists, and the Founders and notable Saints of the Religious Orders.</p>

Architect.</p>

<p>Gelatine Plates (from nature), 13 &times; 16. Each in portfolio. $5.00.</p>

<p>The remarkable success of the first Monograph shows the demand existing
for artistic work of this high grade; and an equal sale may be
predicted for the portfolio that illustrates the beautiful marble Gothic
building of the Connecticut State Capitol. This possesses perhaps even
a higher interest than the Harvard Law School, because it is a great public
building, and not an appendage of an institution.</p>

<p><i>The American Architect</i> says: "The execution of the work is all that
could be asked. It would be hard to offer a more encouraging example of
the kind of work to be expected in this series."</p>

Foote</span>, Author of "The Led Horse Claim," &amp;c. 1 vol. 12mo. $1.50.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Foote's first novel raised her to a level on which she is only to be
compared with our best women novelists. To make this comparison briefly,
Miss Woolson observes keenly, Mrs. Burnett writes charmingly, and Mrs.
Foote feels intensely."&mdash;<i>The Critic.</i></p>

<p><i>NEXT DOOR.</i> By <span class="smcap">Clara Louise Burnham</span>, Author of
"Dearly Bought," "A Sane Lunatic," &amp;c. 1 vol. 12mo. $1.50.</p>

<p>One of the brightest, prettiest, and most charming tales yet offered to the
public. The scene is in Boston, the time the present, the plot exciting, the
characters lifelike, while the style is graceful and skilful.</p>

Author of "Emerson; His Life, Writings and Philosophy." 1 vol. 12mo.

the deepest mental sympathy with his subjects. His present work embraces
Tennyson, Ruskin, and Browning.</p>

<p><i>THE OLDEN-TIME SERIES.</i> 16mo. Per vol., 50 cents.</p>

<p>There appears to be, from year to year, a growing popular taste for quaint
and curious reminiscences of "Ye Olden Time," and to meet this, Mr.
Henry M. Brooks has prepared a series of interesting handbooks. The
materials have been gleaned chiefly from old newspapers of Boston and
Salem, sources not easily accessible, and while not professing to be history,
the volumes will contain much material for history, so combined and
presented as to be both amusing and instructive. The titles of some of the
volumes indicate their scope and their promise of entertainment:&mdash;"Curiosities
of the Old Lottery," "Days of the Spinning Wheel," "Some
Strange and Curious Punishments," "Quaint and Curious Advertisements,"
"Literary Curiosities," "New-England Sunday," etc.</p>

<p>This admirable and impressive work is a companion to the same author's
well-known "Historical Monuments of France," and contains a vivid
record of the life of Merrie England, as exemplified by her august castles
and palaces, abbeys and cathedrals.</p>

<p>"Mr. Howells's new story is in his pleasantest vein, full of his quiet humor
clothed in the neatest expressions. It is international; the contrast of
American and foreign ways runs through it, and Mr. Howells has added
the contrast of the old and the new Americanism. The hero is a Western
journalist, a Mugwump, much given to banter of the American sort."&mdash;<i>The
Nation.</i></p>

<p>This volume of short stories, reprinted from the author's contributions
to the <i>Atlantic</i>, <i>Harpers</i>, <i>The Galaxy</i>, &amp;c., will be found like
"Somebody's Neighbors," to show "that profound insight into Puritan
character, and that remarkable command of Yankee dialect, in which Mrs.
Cooke has but one equal, and no superior. These exquisite chronicles are
full of high local color, pathos and piquancy, and their perusal is attended
with alternate tears and smiles. Their narration is vigorous and spirited,
sparkling in all points, and outlined with rare dramatic skill."</p>

<p><i>THE LIFE AND GENIUS OF GOETHE.</i> The Lectures

States for years. It is rich in domestic, personal, and family interest, anecdotes,
reminiscences, and other thoroughly charming <i>memorabilia</i>.</p>

THE</p>
<h3>AMERICAN ARCHITECT</h3>
<p class="center"><i>AND BUILDING NEWS</i>.</p>

<p>An Illustrated Weekly Journal of Architecture and the Building Trades</p>
<hr style='width: 5%;' />
<p>Each number is accompanied by six fine quarto illustrations, while
illustrative cuts are liberally used in the text. Although the paper
addresses itself primarily to architects and builders, by its discussions
upon matters of interest common to those engaged in building pursuits,
it is the object of the editors to make it acceptable and necessary to
that large portion of the educated classes who are interested in and
appreciate the importance of good architectural surroundings, to civil
and sanitary engineers, draughtsmen, antiquaries, craftsmen of all kinds,
and all intelligent readers.</p>

<p>As an indication of the feeling with which this journal is regarded
by the profession, we quote the following extract from a report of a committee
of the American Institute of Architects upon "American Architectural
Journals":&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"At Boston, Mass., is issued the <span class="smcap">American Architect and Building
News</span>, a weekly of the first class, and, it must be acknowledged, the only
journal in this country that can compare favorably with the great London
architectural publications. It is very liberally illustrated with full-page lithographic
impressions of the latest designs of our most noted architects, and with
occasional views of celebrated European buildings. Once a month a fine gelatine
print is issued in a special edition. Its editorial department is conducted in a
scholarly, courteous, and, at the same time, independent tone, and its selections
made with excellent judgment. It is the accepted exemplar of American architectural
practice, and is found in the office of almost every architect in the
Union."&mdash;<i>April 15, 1885.</i></p></div>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
